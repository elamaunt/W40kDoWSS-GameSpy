 Hello! You are on elamaunt's server THUNDERHAWK.

Wellcome on betatest.
The server is almost complete. There are some minor bugs and the inability to play as a team of friends in automatch.
Statistics changes only on the latest version of the ThunderHawk mod (automatically updates by launcher as startup).
